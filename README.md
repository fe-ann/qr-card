## My process

I was stuck at making text look the same before adding fonts and was wondering why the text was going out of the div even though my measrements were right. Then i added font and yea it was fixed lol.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

i learned i should really take the fonts seriously in designs, also i could make the code better by wrapping the two text divs in one parent div but this work too..
